# Workshop 3 - Functions

You‚Äôll be working in pairs again - **driver/navigator** style, same as before.
Start by setting up the workshop in the same way as the previous two.

For each of the **bold** questions below:

<h3 align="center">
  üó£ Discuss &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üë©‚Äçüíª Change &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üëÄ Observe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üîÑ Repeat
</h3>

1. **üó£ Discuss** the question with your partner
1. **üë©‚Äçüíª Change the code** - what do you expect your changes to do?
1. **üëÄ Observe the results** - what happened when you ran your code? How did it
   differ from your expectations
1. **üîÑ Repeat** - keep discussing, changing, and running the code until you
   feel you understand it

**Remember, it‚Äôs about exploration and understanding. Take your time!**

**Don‚Äôt move on until you fully understand what‚Äôs happening.**

# Part 1

New git commands! As you work, you should be **add**ing and **commit**ing your
code. Check out the
[git cheat sheat on GitBook](https://adaapp.gitbook.io/digital-innovation/guides/git-cheat-sheet)
for help! Ideally, you should create a new commit every 15 minutes or so - try
adding a new one every time you answer a question.

Once you've made several commits, you need to send them back to github. When we
`clone`d the project in the first place, git remembered where we got it from.
You can see this by running this command:

```sh
git remote --verbose
```

The `origin` should be your GitHub repository. We can send our new changes back
to GitHub by **push**ing them:

```sh
git push
```

If the command was successful, you shoulkd be able to go to your own GitHub
repository and see the most up to date changes!

**Go back to your previous two workshops and make sure all your changes have
been committed and pushed.**

**As you complete this workshop, commit and push your changes as you go.**

# Part 2

Functions let us break a program up into **small, reusable chunks**. We‚Äôve
written some already - `draw` and `setup` are special functions that P5.js
already knows about. We‚Äôve used lots of functions as well - any word followed by
`()` is a function - `ellipse(...)`, `rect(...)`, `fill(...)`, `background(...)`
etc.

Create a new sketch with this code: (if you're not sure how to create a new
sketch, refer back to the previous workshop)

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
}

function draw() {
  fill(255, 130, 0)
  stroke(0)
  triangle(0, 30, 40, 0, 80, 30)
  rect(5, 30, 70, 70)
}
```

**Annotate each line with a `// comment` describing what it does**

**Predict what this will draw when you run it.** Try using a pen and paper to
help you figure it out.

Let‚Äôs add our own function. Processing has built-in functions for drawing
rectangles and other shapes, but let‚Äôs add a new one that draws squares. Add
this code to your sketch:

```js
function square(x, y, size) {
  rect(x, y, size, size)
}
```

Replace `rect(5, 30, 70, 70)` with `square(5, 30, 70)` and run your code.

**What‚Äôs going on here? What might `x, y, size` mean?**

**Add a comment above your function saying what the inputs and outputs of your
function are (name, description, data type) and what your functions does.** You
should add a comment like this to every function you write.

Let‚Äôs create some more functions - one for drawing the roof of the house, and
another for drawing the entire house.

**Create functions using the code below as a starting point.** Your house
function should only use the square and roof functions that we defined.

```js
function roof(x, y) {
  // ...
}

function house(x, y) {
  // ...
}
```

## Tasks

1. Change `draw` to use the new `house` function.
2. Change `draw` to show a `hous at the position of the mouse pointer.
3. Change `draw` to show a row of three houses.
4. Change your `house` function so it needs `width` and `height` as well as `x`
   any `y`
5. Update `draw` so your row of three houses each has a different size.

**What are three reasons you might choose to move to some code into a
function?**

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

# Part 3

As well as executing a set of instructions, functions can give information back
to the code that uses them. For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing an application
to help you do your taxes - exciting, I know. You might have a line of code like
this:

```js
var taxAmount =
  (56.6 * myIncome) / theTaxRate - catNumber + (theTaxRate - (67.2 % ennui))
```

> _(i dont know how taxes work but this random crap i wrote is probably more or
> less it right?)_

That‚Äôs a pretty complicated calculation, so we might decide to clear up the code
by **refactoring** it into a function:

```js
function calculateTaxAmount(income, taxRate) {
  return (56.6 * income) / taxRate - catNumber + (taxRate - (67.2 % ennui))
}

var taxAmount = calculateTaxAmount(myIncome, theTaxRate)
```

Now, whenever we need to calculate a tax amount, we can call that function and
not need to worry about the messy calculation.

That `return` key word is important - when we call a function, whatever comes
after `return` gets used as a value by the program. For example:

```js
function double(someNumber) {
  return someNumber + someNumber
}

// these three lines all do the same thing:
console.log(double(4))
console.log(4 + 4)
console.log(8)
```

---

Look closely at this line:

```js
function calculateTaxAmount(income, taxRate) {
```

**What might each section mean?**

- `function`: ...
- `calculateTaxAmount`: ...
- `income, taxRate`: ...

All together, that line is describes most of the function‚Äôs **signature**. The
signature is the **name** of the function, its **inputs**, and its **outputs**.

# Part 4

Look at the programs below. Read each one carefully, and **trace through it on
paper** - write each line that gets executed, and the value of each variable
every time it changes.

> _Note:_ you might find this process a bit basic or frustrating. That's
> understandable - we think of code as for computers, and you're not a computer!
> You're (probably) a person with proper squishy organs and stuff.
>
> Even so, stepping through a piece of code like this on paper makes you be
> really explicit and deliberate, and is a great way of checking your
> understanding of something.
>
> This is a great technique for when you get stuck later on too. Most of how you
> get 'unstuck' when coding is just by slowing down and really rigorously
> checking your understanding of something.

Once you've traced through the code on paper, write your expected output in this
document and run the code. Record the actual output. If it's different, can you
figure out why? Try running through your trace again or getting another pair to
check it.

## Program 1

```js
function setup() {
  console.log(3 + 3 + 3)
}
```

### Expected Output

### Actual Output

### Different? Why?

## Program 2

```js
var two = 4
function setup() {
  console.log(two + two + two)
}
```

### Expected Output

### Actual Output

### Different? Why?

## Program 3

```js
function boop(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

function setup() {
  console.log(boop(1, 2))
}
```

### Expected Output

### Actual Output

### Different? Why?

## Program 4

```js
function boop(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

function setup() {
  console.log(boop(boop(1, 2), boop(3, 4)))
}
```

### Expected Output

### Actual Output

### Different? Why?

## Program 5

```js
function boop(a, b) {
  return 'Boop is good'
}

function setup() {
  console.log(boop(5, 7))
}
```

# Part 5

Create a new sketch using this code:

```js
var x = 0
var speed = 2

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 100)
}

function draw() {
  background(0)

  x = x + speed

  if (x < 0) {
    speed = speed * -1
  } else if (x > 300) {
    speed = speed * -1
  }

  ellipse(x, 30, 10, 10)
}
```

**Before you run it, try to predict what will happen on screen.** If you find
this difficult, sketch it out on a piece of paper and trace through the code
step by step, as if you were the computer.

**Run the code and see what happens. Was your prediction accurate? If not,
why?**

Replace the section that causes the ball to bounce with this:

```js
if (ballShouldBounce(ballPosition)) {
  speed = speed * -1
}
```

- Implement the `ballShouldBounce` function.
- Move the entire bounce `if` statement into a new function.
- Make the ball move vertically as well as horizontally
- Refactor your code by adding functions until `draw` only uses functions you've
  written, not ones from processing
- Turn your sketch into a small game
